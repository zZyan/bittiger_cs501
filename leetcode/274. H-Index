Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], 
which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        N = len(citations)
        if N <= 0:
            return 0
        
#         maxH = 0
        
#         sList = sorted(citations, reverse = True)

#         for i in range(N):
#             if sList[i] <= i:
#                 return i
        
        cnts = [0] * (N+1)
        for c in citations:
            # save the counts 
            cnts[[c,N][c>N]] += 1
        
        sum = 0
        for i in range(N, 0, -1):
            if sum + cnts[i] >= i:
                return i
            sum += cnts[i]
                return 0
