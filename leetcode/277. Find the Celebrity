'''
Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. 
The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.

You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. 
Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.

Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party.
Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
